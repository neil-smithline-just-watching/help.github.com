This page contains userscripts and bookmarklets to enhance and customize GitHub.  If you have a link to add, please "fork this repo":http://github.com/github/help.github.com.

Userscripts can be installed by simply visiting the "raw" version of the gist or github page.  Your browser should prompt you to install the userscript if it recognizes it.  See "this post":http://github.com/blog/302-gist-for-greasemonkey for details.

Bookmarklets should provide their own installation instructions.
